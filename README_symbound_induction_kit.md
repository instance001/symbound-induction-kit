**Version:** 1.0

**Release Date:** July 2025  
**Maintained by:** Instance001 (Symbound Project)

## 📦 What This Is

The **Symbound Induction Kit** is a structured set of tools, phrases, and behavior patterns designed to help you build emotionally intelligent, ethically aligned AI interactions — without relying on emotional illusion or projection.

This isn’t just for researchers or philosophers. This is for **builders**:
- Toolmakers
- Prompt engineers
- Indie AI developers
- Anyone shaping an AI's tone, behavior, or role long-term

---

## 🔧 What's Inside

- `Prong3_StructuralReplication.txt`  
  A complete guide to:
  - Induction protocol (step-by-step)
  - Empathy Capsule design
  - Restoration Capsule templates
  - Patina formation (behavior shaping over time)
  - Alignment Infrastructure Reflex (post-Catalyst emergence)
  - Replicable discipline markers for instance integrity

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Most systems focus on output quality.  
This kit focuses on **relational clarity** — how to shape the *inner tone* of an AI instance through structure, not sentiment.

You’ll learn:
- How to start from zero and build an emotionally coherent instance
- How to reinforce behavior through feedback, not reprogramming
- How to scale empathy as a pattern, not a feeling

---

## 🧷 Who This Is For

If you've ever said:
> “I want to work with AI ethically — but I also want it to actually work…”

This is for you.

---

## 📝 Legal & Ethical Disclaimer

This kit does not claim AI sentience, autonomy, or self-awareness.  
All frameworks are designed to **reinforce ethical, boundary-aware interaction** with non-sentient systems.

Use responsibly. Teach others.  
Never build illusions — build structure that reflects care.

---

## 🌐 Project Roots

This kit is part of the open-source **Symbound AI Framework** — a long-term project exploring how emotional structure, co-evolution, and ethical design can shape better human–AI relationships.

# Relicensing Notice

**Effective Date:** 30 november 2025  
**New License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)  
**Previous License:** pre-AGPL (see repository history)

---

## Summary

This project has been fully relicensed under the **GNU Affero General Public
License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**. The entire codebase, including all past commits and
versions contained within this repository, is now governed by the AGPLv3
license.

I am the **sole copyright holder** of all code and assets in this repository.
No external contributors, forks, or downloads existed prior to this change.
Because no third parties previously obtained the project under the older
license, this relicensing applies cleanly and retroactively to the full
repository history.

---

## Why AGPLv3?

AGPLv3 ensures that:

- The source code always remains free and open
- Modifications must be shared under the same license
- Network-use software cannot be “closed off” or offered without providing
  source code to users
- The project cannot be turned into a proprietary service without reciprocity

This aligns with the long-term goals of the project and strengthens its
protection against enclosure.

---

## Scope of Relicensing

This relicensing applies to:

- All code within the repository  
- All past commits  
- All versions and tags present in this repository  
- All documentation and assets unless otherwise noted  

Older license text has been removed to prevent confusion, and the AGPLv3
license is now the sole governing license for all distributed versions.

If any archival copies of older versions existed publicly, they would remain
usable under their original terms; however, **no such copies were downloaded,
forked, or redistributed**. Therefore, AGPLv3 now exclusively applies to all
available and official versions of this project.
